# Verilog Simulation Repository

## My Name: Bhargav

### Purpose of the Repository
I created this repository to help those who are stuck with Verilog simulation. The codes provided here are the ones that I have worked on and for which I got the correct output during my simulations. 

However, **some of the codes might have issues**, so I highly recommend running the simulation on your own system. If you encounter any bugs, please feel free to let me know, and I'll try my best to fix them.

### Important Notes
- Not all the codes in this repository are written entirely by me. I used the help of **ChatGPT** to complete certain sections of the code.
- The simulation printouts attached are based on the code provided in this repository. The outputs are generated where the output ports are mapped with **port mapping**, instead of mapping by name.

### How You Can Help
I'm sharing these codes to encourage you to try them out yourself. If you find that I might have missed something or if you have any suggestions for improvement, **please let me know**.

### Final Words of Advice
Please **don't just copy and paste** these codes without giving them a try. **Learning comes from practice**, and unless you try to understand and run the simulation yourself, you won't truly learn.

Happy coding and simulation! ðŸ˜Š
